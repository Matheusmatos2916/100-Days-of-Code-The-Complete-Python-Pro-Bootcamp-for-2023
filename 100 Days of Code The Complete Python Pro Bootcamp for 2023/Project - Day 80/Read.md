## Capstone Project - Predict House Prices


Welcome to the Capstone Project - Predict House Prices repository! This repository serves as a guide and resource for your capstone project, where the goal is to predict house prices using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction
Predicting house prices is a common and important problem in the real estate industry. The ability to accurately estimate house prices can assist homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions. In this capstone project, you will leverage your knowledge of machine learning algorithms, feature engineering, and model evaluation to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on various features.

## Features
Detailed project description, including the problem statement and goals.
Dataset exploration and analysis to understand the available features and their relationships with house prices.
Data preprocessing techniques, such as handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
Model development using various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
Evaluation and comparison of different models using appropriate metrics and techniques, such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
Final model selection, interpretation, and deployment considerations.
