# My First GUI with Python

My First GUI with Python is a simple Python application that demonstrates how to create a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library. The application includes a basic window with a label and a button that displays a message when clicked.

The code for the application is available as an open-source repository on GitHub, and it includes comments and documentation to help new users understand how the code works. The repository also includes instructions for setting up and running the application on your local machine.

In addition to demonstrating how to create a GUI using tkinter, the My First GUI with Python application also serves as a starting point for building more complex GUI applications. The code can be easily modified and extended to include additional buttons, labels, and other GUI elements.

If you're new to Python and want to learn how to create GUI applications, the My First GUI with Python repository is a great place to start. The code is simple and easy to understand, and it provides a solid foundation for building more advanced GUI applications in the future.

If you're an experienced Python developer, you can also contribute to the My First GUI with Python repository by submitting bug fixes, new features, or other improvements to the existing codebase. We welcome contributions of all kinds, and we're committed to making this a valuable resource for the Python community.
