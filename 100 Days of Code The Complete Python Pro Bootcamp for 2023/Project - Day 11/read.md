# Blackjack

Blackjack is a console-based Python game where players can play a simplified version of the popular card game. The project is available as an open-source repository on GitHub and is designed to be easy to understand and modify.

In the game, the player is dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). The goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. The player can also choose to "double down" (double their bet and receive one more card) or "split" (if they have two cards of the same rank, they can split them into two separate hands).

The Blackjack project is a great example of how programming can be used to create fun and engaging games that require strategy and decision-making. It's a great tool for anyone who wants to learn about game design or wants to implement similar games in their own projects.
