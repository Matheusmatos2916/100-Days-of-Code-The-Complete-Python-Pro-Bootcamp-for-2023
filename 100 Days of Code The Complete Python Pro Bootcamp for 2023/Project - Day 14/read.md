# Higher Lower Game


Higher Lower is a console-based Python game where players try to guess whether a randomly generated number is higher or lower than the previous number. The project is available as an open-source repository on GitHub and is designed to be easy to understand and modify.

In the game, the player is shown a starting number and must guess whether the next number will be higher or lower. If they guess correctly, they continue playing and their score increases. If they guess incorrectly, the game ends and their score is displayed.

The Higher Lower Game project is a great example of how programming can be used to create simple yet engaging games that require strategy and decision-making. It's a great tool for anyone who wants to learn about game design or wants to implement similar games in their own projects.
