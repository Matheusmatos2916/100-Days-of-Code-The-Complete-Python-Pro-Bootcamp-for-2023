# The Flight Deal Finder 

The Flight Deal Finder is a Python script that helps you find the cheapest flight deals from your chosen departure airport to destinations all around the world. It uses the Google Flights API to search for flight prices and returns a list of the cheapest flights found.

The script allows you to set various parameters, such as the departure airport, the maximum price you are willing to pay, the duration of the trip, and more. You can also specify a list of destinations you are interested in, and the script will search for the cheapest flights to each of these destinations.

Once the script has found the cheapest flights, it can send you an email notification with the details of the flights, including the price, the airline, and the dates of travel. This makes it easy to stay on top of the latest flight deals and book your next vacation at a great price.

The Flight Deal Finder is a great tool for anyone who loves to travel and wants to save money on flights. It is also a great example of how Python can be used to automate tasks and make our lives easier.
