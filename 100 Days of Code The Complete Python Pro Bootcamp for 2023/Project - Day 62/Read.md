## Flask WTForms, Bootstrap, and CSV - Coffee & Wifi Project

The "Coffee & Wifi" project is a web application developed using Flask, WTForms, Bootstrap, and CSV. This project aims to provide users with a platform to discover coffee shops that offer Wi-Fi connectivity. The application allows users to search for coffee shops based on location and filter the results based on various criteria. The project utilizes Flask as the web framework, WTForms for form validation and rendering, Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly design, and CSV for data storage and retrieval.

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It provides a solid foundation for building web applications, offering features like routing, request handling, and template rendering. In the Coffee & Wifi project, Flask is used as the core framework to handle HTTP requests, route them to the appropriate handlers, and generate dynamic web pages.

WTForms is a flexible form validation and rendering library for Python web development. It simplifies the process of handling form data, validating inputs, and rendering form fields. In the Coffee & Wifi project, WTForms is used to create forms for user input, such as location search and filter options. It ensures that the submitted data is valid and provides a seamless user experience.

Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that helps create responsive and visually appealing web designs. It provides a wide range of pre-built components and styles that can be easily customized. In the Coffee & Wifi project, Bootstrap is used to enhance the user interface by adding responsive layouts, navigation menus, buttons, and other UI elements. This ensures that the application is accessible and looks great on various devices.

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple file format used for storing tabular data. In the Coffee & Wifi project, CSV is used as a lightweight database to store information about coffee shops, such as their names, locations, Wi-Fi availability, and other relevant details. The application reads the data from the CSV file, performs searches and filters based on user input, and presents the results dynamically.

The Coffee & Wifi project showcases the integration of Flask, WTForms, Bootstrap, and CSV to develop a web application for discovering coffee shops with Wi-Fi connectivity. Flask provides the foundation for handling HTTP requests and generating dynamic web pages, while WTForms ensures the validity of user inputs. Bootstrap enhances the user interface with responsive design elements, and CSV serves as a lightweight database for storing coffee shop information. Together, these technologies create a functional and user-friendly application for coffee enthusiasts to find the perfect spot to enjoy their favorite brew while staying connected.
