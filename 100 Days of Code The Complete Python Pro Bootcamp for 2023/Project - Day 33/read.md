# Issoverhead API with Python

Issoverhead API is a Python package that provides access to the issoverhead.com website, which offers an online service to verify if a given email address has been leaked in any known data breach. This package simplifies the process of checking email addresses for potential security breaches by allowing developers to integrate this functionality into their own applications.

The Issoverhead API package is open-source and available on GitHub. The package includes documentation and examples to help users get started with the API. The API can be used to check single email addresses or to check a list of email addresses in bulk.

The API returns a JSON response containing information about the email address, including whether or not it has been compromised in any known data breaches. The response also includes information about the number of times the email address has been found in data breaches and the dates of the most recent breaches.

The Issoverhead API is a valuable tool for developers and security professionals who want to ensure that their users' email addresses are secure. By integrating the API into their applications, developers can quickly and easily check email addresses for potential security risks.
