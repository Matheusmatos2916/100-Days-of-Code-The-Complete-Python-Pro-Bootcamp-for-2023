# Birthday Wisher with Python

The Birthday Wisher is a Python script that sends automated birthday wishes to people on their special day. The script uses the third-party library smtplib to send emails and the datetime module to calculate the current date and compare it to the date of each person's birthday.

The code for the Birthday Wisher is available as an open-source repository on GitHub, and it includes comments and documentation to help new users understand how the code works. The repository also includes instructions for setting up and running the script on your local machine.

The Birthday Wisher allows users to store information about people's birthdays in a simple CSV file. The script reads this file and sends a personalized email to each person on their birthday. The user can customize the email message and subject line, as well as the time at which the script runs.

The Birthday Wisher is a useful tool for anyone who wants to stay in touch with friends and family and show them that they care. It can be easily adapted to work with other special occasions, such as anniversaries or holidays.
