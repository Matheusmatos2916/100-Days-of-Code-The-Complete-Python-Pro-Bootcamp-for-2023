# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique used in cryptography. The cipher involves shifting each letter of the plaintext by a certain number of positions down the alphabet. The number of positions is known as the key, and it can be any value between 1 and 25.

The Caesar Cipher project is a Python implementation of this encryption technique. The project is available as an open-source repository on GitHub and is designed to be easy to understand and modify.

In the project, the user can input a plaintext message and a key value. The program then encrypts the message using the Caesar Cipher technique and outputs the resulting ciphertext. The user can also decrypt a ciphertext message using the same key value to obtain the original plaintext message.

The Caesar Cipher project is a great example of how programming can be used to create simple encryption techniques that can be used in various applications. It's a great tool for anyone who wants to learn about cryptography or wants to implement encryption techniques in their own projects.

If you're interested in contributing to the Caesar Cipher project, you can do so by forking the repository on GitHub and submitting a pull request. We welcome contributions of all kinds, including new features, bug fixes, and improvements to the existing codebase.

In summary, the Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique used in cryptography. The Caesar Cipher project is a Python implementation of this encryption technique and is available as an open-source repository on GitHub.
