# Rain-Alert

Rain-Alert is a Python script that sends email notifications when it's going to rain in a specific location. The script uses the third-party library requests to make API requests to the OpenWeatherMap API and the smtplib library to send emails.

The code for Rain-Alert is available as an open-source repository on GitHub, and it includes comments and documentation to help new users understand how the code works. The repository also includes instructions for setting up and running the script on your local machine.

Rain-Alert allows users to specify a location and a threshold for rain probability. The script checks the weather forecast for the specified location and sends an email notification if the probability of rain is above the threshold. The user can customize the email subject line and message to suit their preferences.

Rain-Alert is a useful tool for anyone who wants to stay informed about the weather conditions in their area and avoid getting caught in the rain. It can be easily adapted to work with other weather APIs or to send notifications via other channels, such as SMS or Slack.
