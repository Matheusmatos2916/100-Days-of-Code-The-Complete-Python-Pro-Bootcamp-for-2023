# Hangman

Hangman is a classic word guessing game where the player has to guess a hidden word by guessing individual letters. The game is developed using Python programming language and is available as an open-source repository on GitHub.

In the game, the player is presented with a series of blank spaces representing the letters of a hidden word. The player then guesses one letter at a time, and if the letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct position. However, if the letter is not in the word, the player loses a life. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

The Hangman project is designed to be easy to play, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows the player to make guesses and progress through the game. The game also features a variety of difficulty levels, ensuring a fun and challenging experience for players of all skill levels.

This project is a great example of how programming can be used to create fun and engaging games that have been popular for generations. The Hangman game can be enjoyed by anyone who loves word games and puzzles.
