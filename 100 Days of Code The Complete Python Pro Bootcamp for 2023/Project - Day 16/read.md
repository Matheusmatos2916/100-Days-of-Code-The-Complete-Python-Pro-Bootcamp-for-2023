# Coffee Machine with OOP in Python

The Coffee Machine with OOP is a console-based Python project that simulates a coffee machine using object-oriented programming principles. It allows users to select and order different types of coffee and adjust their ingredients, such as the amount of sugar or milk. The project is available as an open-source repository on GitHub and is designed to be easy to understand and modify.

In the coffee machine project with OOP, classes are used to represent the coffee machine, the types of coffee, and the ingredients. Methods within these classes are used to handle the ordering, payment, and preparation of coffee. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming to create a more organized and modular codebase.

The Coffee Machine with OOP project is a great example of how object-oriented programming can be used to simulate real-world processes and help automate them. It's a great tool for anyone who wants to learn about object-oriented programming or wants to implement similar projects in their own work.
