# Coffee Machine

The Coffee Machine is a simple console-based Python project that simulates a coffee machine. It allows users to select and order different types of coffee and adjust their ingredients, such as the amount of sugar or milk. The project is available as an open-source repository on GitHub and is designed to be easy to understand and modify.

In the coffee machine project, users are prompted to select the type of coffee they want and the amount of each ingredient they want to add. The program then calculates the total cost and asks the user to insert the payment. If the payment is sufficient, the coffee is prepared, and the change is returned to the user.

The Coffee Machine project is a great example of how programming can be used to simulate real-world processes and help automate them. It's a great tool for anyone who wants to learn about programming or wants to implement similar projects in their own work.
