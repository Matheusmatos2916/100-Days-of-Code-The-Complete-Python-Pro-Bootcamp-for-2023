# Guess the Number

Guess the Number is a simple console-based Python game where players can try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The project is available as an open-source repository on GitHub and is designed to be easy to understand and modify.

In the game, the player is prompted to input their guess and is informed if their guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number, at which point they are congratulated and given the option to play again.

The Guess the Number project is a great example of how programming can be used to create simple yet engaging games that can be enjoyed by anyone. It's a great tool for anyone who wants to learn about game design or wants to implement similar games in their own projects.
