# Password Manager

Password Manager is a Python-based application that allows users to securely store and manage their passwords. The application uses encryption to protect the passwords, and it includes features for generating strong passwords and searching for stored passwords.

The application includes a user-friendly GUI that displays a list of stored passwords and provides buttons for adding, editing, and deleting passwords. The user can also generate new passwords using the built-in password generator, which creates strong passwords that are difficult to guess.

The code for the application is available as an open-source repository on GitHub, and it includes comments and documentation to help new users understand how the code works. The repository also includes instructions for setting up and running the application on your local machine.

In addition to providing a secure way to store and manage passwords, the Password Manager application also serves as a starting point for building more complex security applications. The code can be easily modified and extended to include additional features, such as two-factor authentication or integration with other security tools.

If you're looking to improve your online security or want to build your own security application, the Password Manager repository is a great place to start. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, and it provides a solid foundation for building more advanced applications in the future.
