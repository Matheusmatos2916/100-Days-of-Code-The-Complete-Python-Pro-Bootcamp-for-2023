# Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around a game board, eating food and growing in size. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or with the walls of the game board. The Snake Game project is a Python implementation of this classic game, using the Pygame library to handle graphics and user input.

The Snake Game project is available as an open-source repository on GitHub and is designed to be easy to understand and modify. It includes multiple game modes and difficulty levels, as well as high score tracking and customization options.

In the Snake Game project, the player controls the snake using the arrow keys on their keyboard. The snake moves around the game board, eating food and growing in size. The game becomes progressively more difficult as the snake grows, making it harder to avoid collisions with itself or the walls of the game board.

The Snake Game project is a great way to learn about game development and Python programming. It demonstrates how to use the Pygame library to handle graphics and user input, as well as how to implement game logic and scoring systems.

If you're interested in contributing to the Snake Game project, you can do so by forking the repository on GitHub and submitting a pull request. We welcome contributions of all kinds, including new features, bug fixes, and improvements to the existing codebase.

In summary, the Snake Game is a classic arcade game that has been implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The project is available as an open-source repository on GitHub and is a great tool for anyone who wants to learn about game development or Python programming.
