## Welcome to the repository for the "Internet Speed Twitter Bot End" project!

This project is designed to help you create a Twitter bot that monitors your internet speed and automatically tweets your current speed. The bot is built using Python and utilizes the Twitter API to post updates.

To get started, you will need to obtain your Twitter API credentials and configure the bot with your internet speed testing service of choice. Once set up, the bot will automatically test your internet speed at set intervals and post updates to your Twitter account.

This repository includes all the necessary code to set up and run the bot, including the main script, configuration files, and dependencies. You can also customize the bot to suit your needs by tweaking the configuration settings or modifying the code.

We hope this project will be helpful in monitoring your internet speed and keeping your followers informed. Happy tweeting!
