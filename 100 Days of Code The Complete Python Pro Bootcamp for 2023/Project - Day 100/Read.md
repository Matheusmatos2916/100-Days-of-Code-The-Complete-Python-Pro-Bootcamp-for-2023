## National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997-2011: Multivariable Regression for Salary Prediction

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of the famous National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997-2011 (NLSY) dataset, focusing on predicting salaries through multivariable regression analysis. The NLSY dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the factors that contribute to individuals' earnings and shedding light on the implications for government policy.

## About the Dataset
The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997-2011 is a representative sample survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It follows a nationally representative cohort of young men and women who were born between 1980 and 1984. The survey tracks various aspects of their lives, including education, employment, earnings, and other socioeconomic characteristics.

## Objective
The primary objective of this repository is to explore the determinants of earnings using the NLSY dataset and build a multivariable regression model to predict salaries. By understanding how earnings are determined, we can gain insights into the factors that influence income disparities and inform government policies aimed at reducing inequality.

## Contents
The repository contains the following:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: This section focuses on cleaning the NLSY dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis. It includes scripts or Jupyter notebooks detailing the steps taken to preprocess the data effectively.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this section, we perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. We visualize key variables, explore their distributions, and examine the relationships between different features and earnings.

Feature Engineering: Here, we engineer relevant features that may enhance the predictive power of our model. This step involves transforming variables, creating interaction terms, and considering other feature selection techniques.

Multivariable Regression: We develop and implement a multivariable regression model to predict salaries based on the selected features. The regression analysis helps us understand the relative importance of different variables in determining earnings.

Model Evaluation: In this section, we evaluate the performance of our regression model using appropriate metrics. We analyze the goodness of fit and assess the significance of the predictors in explaining salary variations.

Discussion and Implications: This part focuses on interpreting the results of the regression analysis and discussing the implications for government policy. We analyze the key factors influencing salaries and provide recommendations for policy interventions to address income disparities.
