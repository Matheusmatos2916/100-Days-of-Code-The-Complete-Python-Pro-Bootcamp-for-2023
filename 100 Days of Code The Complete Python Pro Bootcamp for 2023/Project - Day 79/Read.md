## The Tragic Discovery of Handwashing: t-Tests & Distributions


Welcome to the Tragic Discovery of Handwashing: t-Tests & Distributions repository! This repository provides a comprehensive guide and examples to help you understand and apply t-tests and analyze distributions using Python.

## Introduction
The tragic story of Ignaz Semmelweis highlights the importance of handwashing in preventing the spread of diseases. Semmelweis discovered that handwashing significantly reduced mortality rates in hospitals, but his findings were initially met with resistance. In this repository, we explore the statistical techniques of t-tests and analyzing distributions to understand the significance of Semmelweis' discovery and how to apply these techniques in various scenarios.

## Features
Jupyter Notebook tutorials explaining the concepts of t-tests, hypothesis testing, and analyzing distributions.
Code examples demonstrating how to perform t-tests and analyze distributions using Python's scientific libraries, such as SciPy and NumPy.
Step-by-step instructions for conducting one-sample and independent two-sample t-tests.
Techniques for visualizing and interpreting distributions using histograms, kernel density estimation (KDE), and box plots.
