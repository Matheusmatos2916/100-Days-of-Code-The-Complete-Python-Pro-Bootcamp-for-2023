# Flight Club 

Flight Club in Python is a program that allows users to book flights and manage their flight information. In addition to basic flight information such as departure and arrival times, the program also asks for the user's name, last name, and system email to help identify the user and ensure that the user receives any important notifications related to their flight.

The program uses Python to create a user interface that prompts the user to enter their information and select their desired flight. It then stores the information in a database, which can be accessed later to retrieve and update the user's flight information.

With Flight Club, users can easily search for and book flights, view their flight history, and receive important updates related to their flights. The program is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it a great tool for anyone looking to manage their flights with ease.
