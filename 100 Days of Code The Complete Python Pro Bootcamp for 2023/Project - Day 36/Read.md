# Stock Trading News - SMS Alert

Stock Trading News - SMS Alert is a Python script that sends SMS notifications when significant stock market events occur. The script uses the third-party library Twilio to send SMS messages and the yfinance library to fetch stock data.

The code for Stock Trading News - SMS Alert is available as an open-source repository on GitHub, and it includes comments and documentation to help new users understand how the code works. The repository also includes instructions for setting up and running the script on your local machine.

Stock Trading News - SMS Alert allows users to specify a list of stocks they want to monitor and a threshold for significant price changes. The script periodically fetches the latest stock data for the specified stocks and sends an SMS notification if the price change exceeds the threshold. The user can customize the SMS message to include additional information, such as the current price and percentage change.

Stock Trading News - SMS Alert is a useful tool for anyone who wants to stay informed about the stock market and make timely trades based on significant price movements. It can be easily adapted to work with other financial APIs or to send notifications via other channels, such as email or Slack.
