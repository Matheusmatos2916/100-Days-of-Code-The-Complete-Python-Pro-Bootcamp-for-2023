## Python Turtle Breakout


This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic 80s arcade game Breakout using the Turtle graphics library. The game features a paddle, a ball, and a collection of bricks that the player needs to break by bouncing the ball off the paddle.

## Game Description
Breakout is a single-player game where the player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen. The goal is to use the paddle to bounce a ball and break all the bricks at the top of the screen. The player loses a life if the ball touches the bottom of the screen, and the game ends when all lives are lost. The player earns points for breaking bricks, and the game becomes progressively more challenging as the number of bricks decreases.
