# The Hirst Painting

The Hirst Painting is a Python project that creates a spot painting similar to the works of British artist Damien Hirst. It uses the Python turtle graphics library to create a canvas and randomly select colors from a pre-defined palette. The resulting painting is a beautiful and colorful piece of art that can be easily customized by modifying the number of dots and the colors used.

The project is available as an open-source repository on GitHub and is designed to be easy to understand and modify. It's a great tool for anyone who wants to learn about Python graphics programming or wants to create their own spot painting.
