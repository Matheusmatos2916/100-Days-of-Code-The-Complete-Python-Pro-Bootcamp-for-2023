# Quizzer App with Python

The Quizzer App is a Python program that allows users to create and take quizzes. The program uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the tkinter library, making it easy and intuitive to use.

The code for the Quizzer App is available as an open-source repository on GitHub, and it includes comments and documentation to help new users understand how the code works. The repository also includes instructions for setting up and running the program on your local machine.

The Quizzer App allows users to create multiple-choice questions and store them in a simple JSON file. Users can then take quizzes based on these questions and receive immediate feedback on their answers. The program keeps track of the user's score and displays it at the end of the quiz.

The Quizzer App is a useful tool for anyone who wants to create and take quizzes for educational or entertainment purposes. It can be easily customized to include new question types or to integrate with other tools and technologies.
