## Extracting Insights from US Census Data and the Washington Post's Database on Deaths by Police in the United States
## Overview
This GitHub repository is dedicated to extracting valuable insights from the combination of two crucial datasets: the US Census data and the Washington Post's database on deaths by police in the United States. By leveraging these datasets, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and meaningful insights that can contribute to a better understanding of law enforcement practices, social justice, and systemic issues within the United States.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to shed light on the relationship between demographics, socio-economic factors, and police-involved deaths. By merging the comprehensive US Census data with the detailed information on deaths by police provided by the Washington Post, we can analyze the impact of various factors such as race, income, education, and population density on the frequency and nature of these incidents. This analysis can help identify potential disparities and inform discussions surrounding police reform, accountability, and social justice.

## Data Sources
US Census Data: The US Census Bureau provides a rich collection of demographic and socio-economic data on various geographic levels, including states, counties, and cities. This dataset encompasses information such as population, race, income, education levels, poverty rates, and more.

Washington Post's Database on Deaths by Police: The Washington Post has been meticulously tracking incidents where individuals have died during interactions with law enforcement in the United States. This database includes details like the victim's name, age, race, location, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.
