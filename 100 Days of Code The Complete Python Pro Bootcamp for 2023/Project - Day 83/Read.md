# Text-Based Tic Tac Toe

This repository contains a text-based version of the classic game Tic Tac Toe implemented in Python. The game allows two players to take turns placing their markers on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three markers in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run the `tictactoe.py` script using Python. The game will prompt the players to enter their moves by specifying the row and column numbers where they want to place their marker. The rows and columns are numbered from 0 to 2, representing the positions on the game board as follows:

```
(0, 0) | (0, 1) | (0, 2)
-------+--------+-------
(1, 0) | (1, 1) | (1, 2)
-------+--------+-------
(2, 0) | (2, 1) | (2, 2)
```

The game will display the current state of the board after each move. Once a player achieves three markers in a row, the game will declare the winner, or if the board is filled without a winner, it will result in a tie.

## Features

- Clear and intuitive text-based interface.
- Error handling for invalid moves, ensuring a smooth gaming experience.
- End-of-game detection to determine the winner or a tie.
- Simple and easy-to-understand codebase, making it a great learning resource for beginners.

## Requirements

To run the Tic Tac Toe game, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine. No additional packages or dependencies are required.
